        <p class="description">This poster was created to advertise the 2025 Toyota Corolla.
            <br>In this case, the target audience was Driving Schools, hence why I advertised about the price and advance safety features it is equipped with. (You probably know why)
        <br> As a bonus, I also provided information about the different drivetrains that the Corolla can be equipped with along with the pros of each one.</p>

            <br>In this case, the target audience was a lot larger. It targeted any company who is in need of fleet pick-ups.
            <br>That is why there are 2 different designs. One of them is for physical mailers while the other is meant ot be sent out as a mass email.</p>

                        physical buttons. On a single smooth piece of plastic, they managed to put 5 seperate<br>
                        touch capacitive buttons making it impossible to know where you are clicking<br>
                        without looking down. My creation clips on and adds ridges, making it easier to guide your<br>
                        finger when you're barreling down the highway at 60 mph.</h3>

                        temperature, passenger temperature, driver's heated seats, and passenger's<br>
                        heated seats. Phew! I guess VW is allergic to buttons. My design creates borders<br>
                        between each seperate control, making it easier for your fingers to<br>
                        move to the correct section. (It doesn't help that you can also slide your finger<br>
                        across the plastic to adjust the volume/temperature)</h3>
