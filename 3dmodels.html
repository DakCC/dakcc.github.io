                        As a cost-cutting measure pulled by VW engineers, the interior of the ID4 lacked
                        physical buttons. On a single smooth piece of plastic, they managed to put 5 seperate
                        touch capacitive buttons making it impossible to know where you are clicking
                        without looking down. My creation clips on and adds ridges, making it easier to guide your
                        finger when you're barreling down the highway at 60 mph.</h2>

                        This is for the headlight control. Just like the previous design, this would guide

                        This is one of the worst parts of the car. On another single strip of smooth plastic, you
                        have controls for the... are you ready? Radio power button, radio volume, driver's
                        temperature, passenger temperature, driver's heated seats, and passenger's
                        heated seats. Phew! I guess VW is allergic to buttons. My design creates borders
                        between each seperate control, making it easier for your fingers to
                        move to the correct section. (It doesn't help that you can also slide your finger
                        across the plastic to adjust the volume/temperature)</h2>

                        8/27/25<br>During college orientation, we were provided with our ID card and a dorm key. Since I am a very forgetful person, I decided to design a new phone case with a built-in retractable mechanism for my dorm key
