        <p class="description">This poster was created to advertise the 2025 Toyota Corolla.
            <br>In this case, the target audience was Driving Schools, hence why I advertised about the price and advance safety features it is equipped with. (You probably know why)
        <br> As a bonus, I also provided information about the different drivetrains that the Corolla can be equipped with along with the pros of each one.</p>

        <p class="description">This advertisment was created to showcase the 2025 Toyota Tacoma.
            <br>In this case, the target audience was a lot larger. It targeted any company who is in need of fleet pick-ups.
            <br>That is why there are 2 different designs. One of them is for physical mailers while the other is meant ot be sent out as a mass email.</p>
